## 1. The BDP Database

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the [Protein Data Bank](http://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB for short). It is the second oldest database (after GenBank)

What is currently in the PDB? We can access current composition stats [here](http://www.rcsb.org/)

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
head(stats)
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray

#Substitute comma for nothing 
y <- gsub(",","",x)

#Convert to numeric
sum(as.numeric(y))
```

Turn this snippet into a function so I can use it any time I have this comma problem (i.e. the other columns of this `stats` table)

```{r}
comma.sum <- function(x) {
  #Substitute comma for nothing 
  y <- gsub(",","",x)
  #Convert to numeric
  return(sum(as.numeric(y)))
}
```

```{r}
xray.sum <- comma.sum(stats$X.ray)
em.sum <- comma.sum(stats$EM)
total.sum <- comma.sum(stats$Total)
```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
protein <- comma.sum(stats[1,"Total"])
protein_percent <- protein / total.sum * 100
protein_percent
```


> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

SKIPPED


## 2. Visualizing with Mol-star

Explore the HIV-1 protease structure with PDB code: `1HSG`
Mol-star homepage at https://molstar.org/viewer/.

## 3. Using the bio3d package in R

The Bio3D package is focued on structural bioinformatics


```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

We can see atom data with `pdb$atom`:

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
head(pdbseq(pdb))
```


## 3. Visualization in R

We can make quick 3D viz with the 

```{r}
library(bio3dview)
view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "lightblue", colorScheme = "sse")
```

```{r}
sel <- atom.select(pdb, resno=25)
view.pdb(pdb, cols=c("pink","lightblue"),
         highlight = sel,
         highlight.style = "spacefill")
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can finish off today with a bioinformatics prediction of the functional motions of a protein

We will run a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA)

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
```

```{r}
adk
```
```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
```
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

```{r}
view.nma(m, pdb=adk)
```
